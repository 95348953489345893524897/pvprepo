# Suggesting for the PvP Repo
If you would like to suggest a new article be written or point out an error in the writing/code, post it in the [Issue Tracker](../../issues). Requests for anything PvP related are welcome, since I am usually writing in my free time.
# Contributing to PvP Repo
Anyone is welcome to contribute to this repo (and thank you for considering doing so), but  some standards should be followed in Pull Requests.
## General
1. Contributions should be PvP related
   - Some things may be only loosely PvP related, such as certain movement techniques or the props spawnlist. This is fine. Just try to contribute things that can help the community in some way.
## Writing style
We do not strictly follow any writing standard (MLA, APA, etc.), so these are the guidelines:
1. [Formal English](https://www.touro.edu/departments/writing-center/tutorials/formal-vs-informal-language/) is preferred
    - The repo is meant to be concise in its articles, both to cut extra weight, and to be easier to translate for the friends overseas. Formal English is the best way to meet these needs.
2. Try to source if your claims are unusual or rely on past research
    - You can [link](github.com) the source, add a footnote, use superscript<sup>[[source]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15155778/superscript-in-markdown-github-flavored)</sup>, asterisks, etc. As long as the source is marked clearly, it is fine.
    - Sourcing your own testing is fine, but if you did this, try to explain the testing somewhere.
3. No AI
    - Using AI to write for yourself is unprofessional and frowned upon in writing. Please don't use AI to write for you.
    - If you have an idea you can't convey well, either post the idea in the Issue Tracker, or write the Pull Request yourself. I can suggest edits to your PR if needed so you won't need to use AI.
## Code style
For now, all that I ask is you use [GLuaFixer](https://github.com/FPtje/GLuaFixer), [vscode-glualint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=goz3rr.vscode-glualint), and [GLua Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=venner.vscode-glua-enhanced). <br/>
These make sure that your code is readable enough for me to work with.
