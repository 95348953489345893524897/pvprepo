//--------------------------------
HL2 PRED'S HUDS (HPH.exe HUD maker) https://gamebanana.com/mods/345189 
  - This makes the process a lot simpler, but it isn't meant for Garry's Mod, it was made for HL2. 
  - ***BACK UP THESE FOLDERS*** if you're going to use a hud from HPH, it makes fixing the issues MUCH easier
    - GarrysMod\garrysmod\HPH\scripts
    - GarrysMod\garrysmod\HPH\cfg         // This folder isn't necessary at all, and you should probably delete it. It overwrites valve.rc, which is the file that my config uses.
    - GarrysMod\garrysmod\HPH\materials
    - GarrysMod\garrysmod\HPH\media
    - GarrysMod\garrysmod\HPH\resource
