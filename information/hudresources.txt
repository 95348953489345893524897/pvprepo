HL2 PRED'S HUDS (HPH.exe HUD maker) https://gamebanana.com/mods/345189 
  - This makes the process a lot simpler, but it isn't meant for Garry's Mod, it was made for HL2. 
  - ***BACK UP THESE FOLDERS*** if you're going to use a hud from HPH, it makes fixing the issues MUCH easier
    - GarrysMod\garrysmod\HPH\scripts
    - GarrysMod\garrysmod\HPH\cfg         // This folder isn't necessary at all, and you should probably delete it. It overwrites valve.rc, which is the file that my config uses.
    - GarrysMod\garrysmod\HPH\materials
    - GarrysMod\garrysmod\HPH\media
    - GarrysMod\garrysmod\HPH\resource
  Issues I've come across:
   'TargetIDSmall' isn't a valid font / performing arithmetic on w cl_targetid.lua error  
    - Solution: 
      1. Copy this: https://gist.github.com/95348953489345893524897/42ea70d17f64e3f89bc7da5ab649e4df (Thanks Redox)
      2. Paste into GarrysMod\garrysmod\resource\ClientScheme.res under the "TargetID" section
  - Weapon Icons being boxes
    - Solution: Can't remember
  - Console font being wrong
    - Solution: Can't remember 
   Chat font being wrong / weirdly bold / crunched
    - Solution: 
      1. Go to yourhudbackupfolder/resource/
      2. Open ChatScheme.Res
      3. Copy the bitmap font and fonts sections
        - Usually these lines: 
          - from //////////////////////// BITMAP FONT FILES /////////////////////////////
          - to //
          - or to //////////////////// BORDERS //////////////////////////////
      4. Replace the bitmap font and fonts sections in GarrysMod\garrysmod\resource\ChatScheme.res
