These are all strategies to glitch into unfair PvP bases or to counter them easily

2. Right click on vehicle (Makes it no-collide with everything)

1. Spawn seat
2. Put seat in the air
3. Set precision tool to settings [here](#Precision-tool-settings)

1. Spawn emplacement
2. Set precision tool to settings [here](#Precision-tool-settings)
3. Left click on the turret (not the stand)
