1. Set precision tool to these settings:
   - User level: Experimental (set this setting FIRST!)
   - Freeze target
   - Only collide with player
2. Spawn seat
3. Put seat in the air
4. Left click on it with precision tool (makes it not collide with the world)
5. Left click it with the physgun out and press E immediately
6. Undo the seat after you glitch past the ceiling (takes some practice to time)
