# Premise:
```hud_draw_fixed_reticle 1``` shows a crosshair no matter what. <br/>
Replacing the texture of the fixed reticle allows us to make custom crosshairs. <br/>
You may want a custom crosshair because ```crosshair_setup``` (console command for customizing base crosshair) does not have the crosshair shape you want, or weapon packs like M9K snipers remove your crosshair. <br/>

The texture's path is:
```hl2_textures.vpk\materials\vgui\hud\xbox_reticle.vtf``` 
For the purpose of the guide you can ignore the hl2_textures.vpk path. <br>

# To make a custom crosshair:
1. Create a folder named CustomCrosshair in \GarrysMod\garrysmod\addons.
  - If you don't know how to get to your local files [follow this guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=760447682).
