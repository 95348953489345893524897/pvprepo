// Example of incrementing alias
// This one can be used as a toggle because it goes through only two commands
alias 	"run" 		"run1"			                  // Make alias that has a better name
alias 	"run1"		"alias run run2; command1"    
// Running "run" in console runs "run1", which runs command 1, and then changes the original "run" command to be "run2"
alias 	"run2" 		"alias run run1; command2"
// Now that "run" is set to essentially be "run2", command2 is run when "run" is run in console
bind space run // Pressing space once will do command1, and then the second time space is pressed it will do command2

// Example of longer incrementing alias
alias 	"run" 		"run1"			                 
alias 	"run1"		"alias run run2; command1"    
alias 	"run2" 		"alias run run3; command2"
alias 	"run3" 		"alias run run4; command2"
alias 	"run4" 		"alias run run1; command2"    // Making sure that the last "runN" command returns to run1 using 'alias run run1' is necessary to make sure that the increment restarts itself.
bind space run // Pressing space for the Nth time will run commandN, where N = the amount of times space was pressed.
