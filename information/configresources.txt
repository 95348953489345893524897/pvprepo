//--------------------------------
// Example of incrementing alias
// This alias can be used as a toggle because it goes through only two commands
alias 	"run" 		"run1"			                  // Create original alias that will be modified eventually
alias 	"run1"		"alias run run2; command1"    
// pressing the key bound to "run" runs "run1", which runs command 1, and then changes the original "run" command to become "run2"
alias 	"run2" 		"alias run run1; command2"
// Now that "run" is set to be "run2" now, command2 is run when the key bound to "run" is pressed 
bind space run // Pressing space once will do command1, and then the second time space is pressed it will do command2

//--------------------------------
// Example of longer incrementing alias
alias 	"run" 		"run1"			                 
alias 	"run1"		"alias run run2; command1"    
alias 	"run2" 		"alias run run3; command2"
alias 	"run3" 		"alias run run4; command2"
alias 	"run4" 		"alias run run1; command2"    // Making sure that the last "runN" command returns to run1 using 'alias run run1' is necessary to make sure that the increment restarts itself.
bind space run // Pressing space for the Nth time will run commandN, where N = the amount of times space was pressed.

//--------------------------------
// Example of an incrementing alias using + and - commands
alias +run "+run1"                        // Create original alias that will be modified eventually
alias -run "-run1"                        // Ditto ^

// This works almost the same as a normal incrementing alias, except that it can do a different command on press and release of the key.

alias +run1 "alias +run +run2; CommandOnPress1"     
// Pressing the key bound to "+run" runs CommandOnPress1, and then changes the original "+run" command to become "+run2"
alias -run1 "alias -run -run2; CommandOnRelease1"
// Releasing the key bound to "+run" runs CommandOnRelease1, and then changes the original "-run" command to become "-run2"
alias +run2 "alias +run +run1; CommandOnPress2"
// Now that "+run" is set to be "+run2" now, CommandOnPress2 is ran when the key bound to "+run" is pressed
alias -run2 "alias -run -run1; CommandOnRelease2"
// Now that "+run" is set to be "+run2" now, CommandOnRelease2 is ran when the key bound to "+run" is released

// This type of incrementing alias is useful for when you want to use press/release commands like +attack but also have the increment change when you release the key.
// Setting a +command to be ran using a normal alias does not work, so it has to be made into a +alias.
// For example: 
// alias examplename "+command" 
// Does not work.
// Therefore, the typical method of incrementing aliases would also not work.
// alias 	"run1"		"alias run run2; +command"   : DOES NOT WORK
// alias +run1 "alias +run +run2; +command"     : DOES WORK AS LONG AS THE LINE BELOW ALSO EXISTS
// alias +run1 "alias +run +run2;"
