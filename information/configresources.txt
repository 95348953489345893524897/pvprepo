//--------------------------------
// Incrementing alias
// This alias can be used as a toggle because it goes through only two commands
alias 	"run" 		"run1"			                  // Create original alias that will be modified eventually
alias 	"run1"		"alias run run2; command1"    
// pressing the key bound to "run" runs "run1", which runs command 1, and then changes the original "run" command to become "run2"
alias 	"run2" 		"alias run run1; command2"
// Now that "run" is set to be "run2" now, command2 is run when the key bound to "run" is pressed 
bind space run // Pressing space once will do command1, and then the second time space is pressed it will do command2

// Real example: 
bind key "spawnmeaprop"  // Make bind for the command

alias 	"zoomtoggle" 		"zoomtoggle1"					
alias 	"zoomtoggle1"		"alias zoomtoggle zoomtoggle2; +zoom"    // Use +zoom when I press the key
alias 	"zoomtoggle2" 		"alias zoomtoggle zoomtoggle1; -zoom"  // Stop zooming in when I press the key again
// Using this, you have now made a way of making held down buttons toggleable. 
// This isn't particularly useful in the case of +zoom, since you can just use toggle_zoom, but there are other commands that it can be applied to.

//--------------------------------
// Longer incrementing alias
alias 	"run" 		"run1"			                 
alias 	"run1"		"alias run run2; command1"    
alias 	"run2" 		"alias run run3; command2"
alias 	"run3" 		"alias run run4; command2"
alias 	"run4" 		"alias run run1; command2"    
                        // HERE ^
                          // Making sure that the last "runN" command returns to run1, shown by 'HERE ^', is necessary to make sure that the increment restarts itself.
bind space run // Pressing space for the Nth time will run commandN, where N = the amount of times space was pressed.

Real Example:
//--------------------------------
// Example of an incrementing alias using + and - commands
alias +run "+run1"                        // Create original alias that will be modified eventually
alias -run "-run1"                        // Ditto ^

// This works almost the same as a normal incrementing alias, except that it can do a different command on press and release of the key.

alias +run1 "alias +run +run2; CommandOnPress1"     
// Pressing the key bound to "+run" runs CommandOnPress1, and then changes the original "+run" command to become "+run2"
alias -run1 "alias -run -run2; CommandOnRelease1"
// Releasing the key bound to "+run" runs CommandOnRelease1, and then changes the original "-run" command to become "-run2"
alias +run2 "alias +run +run1; CommandOnPress2"
// Now that "+run" is set to be "+run2" now, CommandOnPress2 is ran when the key bound to "+run" is pressed
alias -run2 "alias -run -run1; CommandOnRelease2"
// Now that "+run" is set to be "+run2" now, CommandOnRelease2 is ran when the key bound to "+run" is released

// This type of incrementing alias is useful for when you want to use press/release commands like +attack but also have the increment change when you release the key.
// Setting a +command to be ran using a normal alias does not work, so it has to be made into a +alias.
// For example: 
// alias examplename "+command" 
// Does not work.
// Therefore, the typical method of incrementing aliases would also not work.
// alias 	"run1"		"alias run run2; +command"   : DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY
// alias +run1 "alias +run +run2; +command"     : DOES WORK AS LONG AS THE LINE BELOW ALSO EXISTS
// alias +run1 "alias +run +run2; -command"  

// Real example of +incrementingalias:
// fast switch m9k weapons by clicking, cancelling the pullout animations more reliably  
alias +m9kswitch "+m9kswitch1"
alias -m9kswitch "-m9kswitch1"
alias +m9kswitch1 "alias +m9kswitch +m9kswitch2; +attack"
alias -m9kswitch1 "alias -m9kswitch -m9kswitch2; -attack"
alias +m9kswitch2 "alias +m9kswitch +m9kswitch1; lastinv"
alias -m9kswitch2 "alias -m9kswitch -m9kswitch1; "
// bind mouse1 +m9kswitch
