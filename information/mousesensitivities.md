##### Terminology: <br/>
###### "CM/360", "CM": How many centimeters (CM) your mouse must move to rotate 360 degrees in-game.
###### "DPI": How many "dots" your cursor moves when your mouse travels a single inch.
###### "Sensitivity", "Sens": How much your camera moves when you move your mouse.

# CM/360
**"CM/360"** is the universal metric for converting between different games' sensitivity scales while accounting for mouse DPI. <br/>
Every game has its own sensitivity scale. 1.00 sens in TF2 is equal to 3.34 in Overwatch.  <br/>
Visualizing sensitivity and DPI together can be confusing, especially with the different sensitivity scales between games, which is what cm/360 is used for. <br/>
For example, saying "46 cm" is much simpler than "0.72285 CSGO sens & 1250 dpi." <br/>

There are a few important things to know in order to understand cm/360 values:

1. **CM/360 values have the opposite meaning of in-game sensitivities.** This means that:

   - Higher cm/360 is slower

   - Lower cm/360 is faster

A simple example: 1.50 quake/source sens on 800 DPI = about 35 cm/360. 1.50 source sens is half as fast as 3.00, but for 35 and 70 cm, it's the opposite; 70 cm is half as fast as 35. Hearing people say "low" or "high" sens can be a bit confusing for this reason, but generally when they say "high/low sens", they mean the sensitivity itself, and not the cm value.

2. **In order to calculate your CM/360, you need to know your mouse's DPI.** There are a few ways to find out your DPI, each with varying degrees of reliability. The most straightforward way is to simply check your mouse's software, if available. If that isn't an option for you, or if you want a more precise measurement, you can attempt to measure your DPI manually, but doing this precisely can be inconvenient. There are online tools to do this, but I personally can't vouch for the efficacy of these.

3. **There is no perfect CM.** There never will be, because sensitivity is a tool, and the range of optimal sensitivity varies for each game and even each aiming situation. Different sensitivities are good for different things. A good demonstration of this is in how pro players across different games use different ranges of sensitivity. In Overwatch, for example, a relatively fast range of sensitivity is used, `(often between ~15-35 cm)` but in Counter-Strike and similar games, a much lower range tends to be used. `(~40-60 cm)` There are obviously outliers to this trend, but the reason it exists at all is because the two games emphasize different elements of mouse control and therefore have different criteria for what makes a good sensitivity.

## "What sensitivity should I use for GMod?"

While there is no "perfect sens", each fps game does have a range of sensitivities that tend to work well. Garry's Mod is rather unique; it has a very diverse set of aiming situations that vary across different weapon packs, on different maps, and depending on the individual's playstyle. Despite this, I don't think GMod is suited for extremely slow sens, like 60 cm/360 (800 dpi, 1.00 source sens). Actually, this brings up a good point, what even is  a "fast" or "slow" sens to begin with?

Here is my attempt at defining an intuitive guideline for sensitivity. The values I'm using here are quite lenient, so if you're using 3 cm and you're surprised that 15 is listed "TOO FAST TO USE!!!", there's definitely a problem, and you should change your sens. There's no benefit to using an unreasonably fast or slow sensitivity, the only use case I can think of for something like 10 cm is if you have extremely limited mousepad space and you physically can't use anything slower.

```
>15cm <-- TOO FAST! DO NOT USE BELOW THIS!!

20-32 cm <- fast, mostly good for highly reactive tracking focused games, many people use very fast sens in lg duels, which focus exclusively on tracking.

33-42 cm <- mid-range, this can work for pretty much any fps game, though it may not be ideal for everything.

43-60 cm <- slow, good for games that focus on highly precise aiming situations where you aren't often presented with a target that moves erratically across your screen

<75cm <-- TOO SLOW! DO NOT USE ABOVE THIS!!
```

For Garry's Mod in particular, if I had to say, `25-50 cm` makes the most sense for the aiming situations seen in game. If you use something within this range, it's not likely to hold you back in any major way.

## "Changing my sensitivity will mess up my muscle memory! Isn't it best to pick one good sensitivity and stick to it for everything?"

The human brain is adaptable, and people are capable of learning things like alternate keyboard layouts in just a few months. Sensitivity is a much smaller change. It's also important to realize that your actual sensitivity isn't a variable you can keep static. Factors like the humidity and temperature of your room, the fov you're using in game, dpi variation between mice, etc, etc, all make your mouse input feel slower or faster than normal. For most people, these things are hardly even noticeable, and it doesn't screw up their aim long term. It's not uncommon for people to use a different sensitivity for each game, and they're usually better for it. Even very high level players tend to change their sensitivity to suit a given environment or task. This obviously doesn't hold them back, seeing as they outperform pretty much everyone else.

PS:THIS DOESNT MEAN YOU SHOULD BE CONSTANTLY CHANGING YOUR SENS IN GAME. While different values are good for different things, it's unlikely that the reason you're performing badly is because you're using 38 cm instead of 36.5. Focus on other issues before you conclude that you need to change your sensitivity. Never change your sensitivity on impulse, it's best to deliberately set a single value and use it rather than impulsively changing your sens every time you become frustrated by poor performance.
