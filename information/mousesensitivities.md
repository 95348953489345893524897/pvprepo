# CM/360 
CM/360 is a standard measurement of mouse input (that is, how much the mouse moves your aim). <br/>
It is measured by how many Centimeters you need to move your mouse to complete a full 360 degree turn in game. <br/>
To convert CM/360 between games or calculate it, use sites like [Kovaak's CM/360 Converter](https://kovaaks.com/kovaaks/cm360-converter). <br/> 
For clarity, I will mark where I am talking about CM/360 instead of game sensitivity. <br/>
```
DPI (AKA CPI): 
DPI stands for Dots Per Inch and is the mouse's sensitivity (that is, how many "Dots" [pixels] the mouse will move
over an Inch)
CPI, which is used interchangably with DPI, stands for Counts Per Inch (the "Counts" are still pixels)

Higher DPI = faster aim
Lower DPI = slower aim

Sensitivity:
This is *not* the sensitivity from the mouse (that would be DPI/CPI), it is handled by the game only

Higher sensitivity = faster aim
Lower sensitivity = slower aim
```
## How do I figure out my DPI?
To figure out your DPI look up the native DPI of your mouse, look through your mouse's software (if it has any), test it<sup>[Add a DPI testing site here or get rid of this item]</sup>, or take a guess (absolutely last resort). <br/>
[This section needs expanding] <br/>

# What sensitivity should I use?
It is overly elitist to assert a rigid standard for mouse sensitivity. However, there comes a point where a Sensitivity* will objectively be a hindrance to your aim. <br/> 
*Generally*, the range of usable Sensitivities* for G-Mod would be this: <br/>
```
Below 15 CM/360: Bad
Around 30 CM/360: Most people use a Sensitivity* around here, you should aim to have it around here
Above 50 CM/360: Bad 
```
[Add data chart about mice DPI here] <br/>
[The explanation of the logic will in the next section in final draft] <br/>
[Explain how you might not have enough space to use a non high CM, and that you are restricted, and sticking to a high sens is (tolerable? permissible? the only resort maybe..)] <br/>

# Drawbacks of settling for a single sensitivity [Will change this header to be more clear] 
[Explain how different sensitivities translate to in game here] <br/>
[Refer to them as extremes or sides of a pole (low, high) for clarity that they are outside of the tolerable range]<br/>
[Ex 1: 15 CM you maybe can track close strafes well, but good luck hitting anything at range]<br/>
[Ex 2: 70 CM you maybe are very smooth and do well at range, but good luck when someone gets close to you or angles]<br/>
Settling for a single sensitivity [Analogy here], blah.<br/>
