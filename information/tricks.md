# ULX Psay spam to locate players 
https://github.com/95348953489345893524897/configs/blob/c0ee0b1b6f92773cb424c19fde8821495925d464/valve.rc#L342
  - !pm '@ message' (also 'ulx psay @' in console) is used to pm the player in the direction that you are facing <br/>
  - Since '@' with ulx shows if your command hit a target (a player), you can use it to locate people in large maps<br/>
  - Binding a key like b to "ulx psay @" lets you spam blank messages in any direction.<br/>
    - If the psay hits a target, it'll say that you need to input a message to pm someone. By knowing where a player is and isn't like this, you can find them much faster.<br/>
    - You can also put in a message to know exactly which player is you're looking at, but it becomes spammy and people will get annoyed you are filling their chat with PMs.<br/>

# Picked up weapon trails
  - Trails placed on weapons using the trail tool will still persist even when the weapon is picked up.<br/>
  - This lets you have trails on yourself without using wire/e2/starfall<br/>
