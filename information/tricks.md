# ULX Psay spam to locate players 
(https://github.com/95348953489345893524897/configs/blob/49f82966c7f41247c35ea3fef978d3f15b5a4e96/valve.rc#L342)
  - !pm '@ message' (also 'ulx psay @' in console) is used to pm the player in the direction that you are facing 
  - Since '@' with ulx shows if your command hit a target (a player), you can use it to locate people in large maps.
  - Binding a key like b to "ulx psay @" lets you spam blank messages in any direction.
    - If the psay hits a target, it'll say that you need to input a message to pm someone. By knowing where a player is and isn't like this, you can find them much faster.
    - You can also put in a message to know exactly which player is in a specific direction, but it becomes spammy and people will get annoyed you are filling their chat with PMs.

# Picked up weapon trails
  - Trails placed on weapons using the trail tool will still persist even when the weapon is picked up.
  - This lets you have trails on yourself without using wire/e2/starfall
