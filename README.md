This is a library of information that I have learned from playing Gmod, as well as resources that I have found and archived or made myself.
It was made for the Gmod sandbox PvP community, but anyone is free to use or share anything in here.  
I do not believe in gatekeeping information from the rest of the community, so this repo will continue to be added onto as I can.
